Root is npm workspace.  The geelib codebase lives in packages/geelib.  Geelib uses aegir (mocha tests), ES modules, and TypeScript.  Tests go in "test" folder and must end in `*.spec.ts`.  Documentation is in `doc` folder.  Note that I have "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true in tsconfig, so be sure to assert not nulls in array access.
