Root is npm workspace.  The geelib codebase lives in packages/geelib.  Geelib uses aegir (mocha tests), ES modules, and TypeScript.  Tests go in "test" folder and must end in `*.spec.ts`.  Tests are ran like this: `cd C:\Projects\Digithought\geelib\packages\geelib && npm run test:node -- -g "<test name>"`  Documentation is in `doc` folder.  Note that "noUncheckedIndexedAccess" is true in tsconfig, so be sure to assert not null ("!") in array access.
